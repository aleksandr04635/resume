## My resume

<div align="justify">
          <div className="text-md flex flex-col gap-4">
          <p>
           Web developer proficient in the full stack of skills, necessary for website creation, from various UI tools to databases, specializing in MERN stack, with testing skills, and with good English.
          </p>
          <p>
           You can see two projects, I have made myself from the very beginning to successful production deployment, on my resume - a MERN blog with comments and tags systems and a Next.js 14 marketplace with user-created categories and products and a system of filtering over them. Both projects use full-blown authentication systems - with Google and Github OAuth options and email and password options, with sending emails for email verification, password resetting, and 2-factor authentication. Both projects use cloud image uploading, integration of a rich text editor, and persisted Redux storage for local variables and queries.
