## My resume

<div align="justify">
          <div className="text-md flex flex-col gap-4">
          <p>
           I'm an expirienced Full-Stack Web Developer with a year of teamwork experience, proficient in the full stack of skills, necessary for web apps creation, from various UI tools to databases, with focus on Next.js, with testing skills, and with English on the level C1-C2.
          </p>
          <p>
           You can see two projects, I have made myself from the very beginning to successful production deployment, on my resume - a MERN blog with comments and tags systems and a Next.js 14 marketplace with user-created categories and products and a system of filtering over them. Both projects use full-blown authentication systems - with Google and Github OAuth options and email and password options, with sending emails for email verification, password resetting, and 2-factor authentication. Both projects use cloud image uploading, integration of a rich text editor, and persisted Redux storage for local variables and queries.
